## Description
### What is an API ?
An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a programming interface that allows applications to communicate with each other.
  
In practical terms, an API allows an application to request information or actions from another application or online service. It acts as an intermediary between two computer systems.
  
APIs are incredibly useful for:
  
- Allowing developers to create third-party applications that integrate with an existing platform or online service.
- Facilitating the sharing of data and functionality between different applications.
- Improving the performance and flexibility of applications.
  
APIs are often based on standard communication protocols such as:
  
1. `REST` (Representational State Transfer), which uses HTTP requests to send data.
2. `SOAP` (Simple Object Access Protocol), which uses an XML format to structure the data exchanged.
  
APIs have become a key element of the modern application ecosystem, as they allow developers to create applications more quickly using third-party services. They are also essential for the development of distributed software architectures.

## Projects

### [API](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-back-end/tree/main/api)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

<details>
<summary>What Bash scripting should not be used for</summary>
<br>

>Bash scripting should not be used for complex applications or high-performance computing tasks. For example, if you need to perform a large number of calculations or process large datasets, a compiled language like C or Java would be more efficient.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is an API</summary>
<br>

>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. For example, the Twitter API allows developers to access and publish tweets from their own applications.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a REST API</summary>
<br>

>A `REST` (Representational State Transfer) `API` is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. For example, the GitHub API uses REST principles to allow developers to access and manage their repositories.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are microservices</summary>
<br>

>Microservices are a software architecture style in which large applications are broken down into smaller, independently deployable services that can communicate with each other through APIs. For example, Netflix uses microservices to enable rapid development and deployment of new features for its streaming platform.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the CSV format</summary>
<br>

>`CSV` (Comma-Separated Values) is a file format used to store tabular data in plain text. For example, a CSV file might be used to store a list of customers and their contact information.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the JSON format</summary>
<br>

>`JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. For example, a JSON file might be used to store configuration data for a web application.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Pythonic Package and module name style</summary>
<br>

>Pythonic package and module names should be lowercase, with no underscores. For example, the `requests`, `numpy`, and `flask` packages follow this convention.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Pythonic Class name style</summary>
<br>

>Pythonic class names should use CamelCase (also known as CapWords), with the first letter of each word capitalized. For example, the `HttpRequest`, `MyClass`, and `CustomerData` classes follow this convention.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Pythonic Variable name style</summary>
<br>

>Pythonic variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. For example, the variables `my_variable`, `http_request`, and `customer_data` follow this convention.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Pythonic Function name style</summary>
<br>

>Pythonic function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. For example, the functions `my_function`, `http_request_handler`, and `calculate_average` follow this convention.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Pythonic Constant name style</summary>
<br>

>Pythonic constant names should be all uppercase, with words separated by underscores. For example, the constants `MY_CONSTANT`, `HTTP_STATUS_OK`, and `PI_VALUE` follow this convention.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python</summary>
<br>

>In Python, CapWords (also known as CamelCase) is commonly used for class names because it makes them more easily distinguishable from variables and functions, which are usually lowercase with underscores. For example, the class name `HttpRequest` is easily distinguishable from the function name `http_request_handler` and the variable name `http_request`.
